# TDD Next.js

This talk is focused around the current testing strategies within the new and upcoming React paradigms, using Next.js as
an example.

This repository contains a single Next.js application that has:

1. a page for `/app` to demonstrate the newest Next.js framework paradigm for App Router (and strategies to test)
2. a page for `/pages` to demonstrate the previous Next.js framework paradigm Pages Router (and strategies to test)

The goal of these two projects is to compare the differences, show some of the reasons why Next.js App Router is set to
improve the overall frontend experience, and to demonstrate some of the early growing pains that come with it ... like
testing.

## Getting Started

### Development mode

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Production mode

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Your app should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
